```

## We-R-Finished

```{r}
# loading libraries
library(readxl)
library(caret)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# dataset overview
salary <- read_excel("C:/Users/knigh/OneDrive/Desktop/Github/We-R-Finished/salary/salary_data_states.xlsx")
dim(salary)
```

### II. What states (of those I am willing to move to) have the highest paying data-related salaries?

#### a. Differences between job sub-categories?

#### b. Which companies have the highest salaries for those sub-types?

#### c. Will the answer change if I take standard of living into account?

```{r, ref.label=knitr::all_labels(), echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
```

# We-R-Finished
## Apr 13, 2023
- Cost of Living 2023 
	- Will start new branch
	- Begin EDA
	- Q6 Development
- RMD of Q6
	- Loaded necessary libraries
	- Dataset
		- Read
		- Filtered out fips
- Columns → variables
- Make top10 dataframe
	- Seems like TX doesn’t like trying to be read
	- At first assuming it’s because i named the filtered dataset as col
	- Therefore it’s reading it somehow like column? Or something similar
	- So renamed as coldf & changed the necessary lines
	- Apparently not, always have to run previous chunks to make it run ok
		- Not sure what problem is
	- Dataframe readability difficulty, will need to try something else
